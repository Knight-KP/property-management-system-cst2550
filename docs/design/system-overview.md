# Property Management System Overview

The system is designed to manage property maintenance tasks and monthly billing for property services.  
The system is divided into four main maintenance areas: Plumbing, Electrical, Cleaning, and Architectural Maintenance.  

Each maintenance module allows users to create maintenance jobs, update job status, and store job details such as description, property ID, date, and cost.  

The system will also generate monthly invoices based on completed maintenance jobs. Invoice data will be stored and linked to property and maintenance records.  

The system will use the custom data structure developed in this project to manage and search maintenance job data. This data will later be stored in the database.  

The project is developed using a team structure where different members are responsible for different maintenance modules and testing.
