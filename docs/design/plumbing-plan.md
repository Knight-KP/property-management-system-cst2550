# Plumbing Maintenance Module Plan

This module will handle plumbing maintenance jobs for properties.  
Users can create new plumbing jobs and view existing ones.  
Each job will store description, property ID, date, status, and cost.  
The module will be accessed from the main menu.  
Data will be stored using the project data structure and later linked to the database.  
This information will also be used when generating monthly invoices.
