# Electrical Maintenance Module Plan

The electrical module will handle electrical maintenance requests for properties (e.g. lighting faults, sockets, fuse issues).  
Users will be able to create a new electrical job, view existing jobs, and update the job status (open / in progress / completed).  
Each job will store a short description, property ID, date reported, status, and estimated or final repair cost.  
The module will be accessed from the main menu under electrical maintenance.  
Electrical job data will be stored using the project’s data structure and later linked to the database.  
This information will also be used when producing monthly invoices.
